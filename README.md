#### Conver dot file to png
Run the following command as your choose:
```
$ python manage.py graph_models -a > dotfile.dot
$ python manage.py graph_models app1 app2 > fire_me.dot
$ python manage.py graph_models -a -I Foo,Bar > something.dot
$ python manage.py graph_models -a X Foo,Bar > nofoobar.dot
```

Now convert dot file to PNG. For this first install pydot, graphviz `pip install graphviz`. Now in python shell :
```
>>> import pydot
>>> (graph,) = pydot.graph_from_dot_file('dotfile.dot')
>>> graph.write_png('somefile.png')
```  

For frontend add your work in the __Frontend__ directory.
We will be using backend api endpoints to connect with the frontend. The EER model will be uploaded here soon.
